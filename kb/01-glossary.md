# Glossary

> **Hineni** uses this hierarchy and these terms unchanged (church structure is derived from
> the FL Admin Portal graph). For check-in routes and event scopes, also read
> [hineni/00-church-structure.md](hineni/00-church-structure.md) and
> [hineni/04-events-and-status.md](hineni/04-events-and-status.md).

Terms exactly as used in this codebase. If a term is not defined here, do not invent
it — search for it first or ask. These are the canonical spellings; do not pluralise
or rename them when writing code (e.g. it is `Bacenta`, not `Bacentas`; `Bussing`, not
`Busing`).

## Church hierarchy

- **Denomination** — top of the hierarchy (one node: First Love Center).
- **Oversight** — a regional grouping of campuses.
- **Campus** — a geographic campus of the church.
- **Stream** — a service-track within a campus. The four canonical names are
  `Anagkazo Encounter`, `Gospel Encounter`, `Holy Ghost Encounter`,
  `First Love Experience` (`StreamOptions` in `web-react-ts/src/global-types.ts`).
- **Council** — a sub-grouping under a Stream that owns Governorships.
- **Governorship** — a sub-grouping under a Council that owns Bacentas.
- **Bacenta** — the leaf node of the church hierarchy; a mid-week home cell.
  A Bacenta has a `meetingDay` of Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday and
  a `bankingCode`. Fellowships have been removed — Bacenta is now the smallest
  unit.
- **Ministry** — a sub-unit under a Stream (also called a "Sonta" in some contexts).

## People

- **Member** — any person in the directory.
- **Servant** — a Member with a leadership or admin assignment. The codebase has a
  `ServantType` union: `Leader | Admin | ArrivalsAdmin | ArrivalsCounter | Teller`.
- **Leader** — the head servant of a church at any level (e.g. `leaderBacenta`).
- **Admin** — an assistant servant for administrative work at a level (e.g.
  `adminCouncil`). No Admin role exists below Governorship.
- **ArrivalsAdmin** / **ArrivalsCounter** / **ArrivalsPayer** / **Teller** —
  specialist servants for the arrivals (bussing) and banking flows. See
  `02-user-roles.md`.
- **Title** — `Pastor | Reverend | Bishop`. Influences the `nameWithTitle` resolver
  (e.g. female Bishop → `Mother`, female Reverend → `LR`, female Pastor → `LP`).
- **Basonta** — a member's creative-arts affiliation (referenced from `Member.basonta`).

## Records

- **ServiceRecord** — a single weekly service entry: attendance, income, family
  picture, treasurers, banking proof. Variants exist as `RehearsalRecord` and
  `StageAttendanceRecord` (same TypeScript union).
- **RehearsalRecord** — service record for a Ministry rehearsal.
- **StageAttendanceRecord** — on-stage attendance during a service.
- **BussingRecord** — a Bacenta's record of bringing members to Sunday service:
  attendance, mobilisation/bussing pictures, vehicle records, top-up payments.
- **VehicleRecord** — one vehicle (Sprinter | Urvan | Car) within a BussingRecord,
  with momo-payout fields.
- **HistoryLog** — append-only audit entry attached to every Church node when
  leadership / status / record-state changes. Created by `loggedBy: Member`.
- **EquipmentRecord** — `bluetoothSpeakers`, `offeringBags`, `pulpits` per church.
- **ServiceLog** — Neo4j relationship type that anchors a church's services
  (`(:Church)-[:HAS_HISTORY]->(:ServiceLog)-[:HAS_SERVICE]->(:ServiceRecord)`).

## Money / banking

- **Banking** — depositing a service's offering after the service. Lives under
  `api/src/resolvers/banking/` and `web-react-ts/src/pages/services/banking/`.
- **Banking slip** — uploaded image proof of a manual bank deposit
  (`ServiceRecord.bankingSlip`).
- **Banking proof** — boolean flag indicating the slip / payment has been verified
  (`ServiceRecord.bankingProof`).
- **Banking confirmer** — the user who confirms a manual banking
  (`ServiceRecord.bankingConfirmer`).
- **Treasurer** — Bacenta-level Member assigned to handle the offering for a
  service. A service has `treasurers: Member[]`.
- **Treasurer selfie** — photo of the treasurer counting money
  (`ServiceRecord.treasurerSelfie`).
- **Self-banking** — a treasurer/leader initiating a Paystack mobile-money debit on
  their own offering (`BankServiceOffering` resolver).
- **Anagkazo banking** — the special banking flow for the Anagkazo school /
  treasury (`api/src/resolvers/anagkazo/treasury-resolvers`).
- **Defaulter** — a church that has not banked a previous service or has not filled
  this week's service form. Tracked under `pages/services/defaulters/` and the
  background `services-not-banked` job.
- **Code of the day** — a daily rotating PIN used for arrivals payments
  (`api/src/functions/background/code-of-the-day`,
  `BacentaWithArrivals.arrivalsCodeOfTheDay`).
- **MOMO** — Mobile Money. `MOMO_NUM_REGEX` validates Ghanaian numbers.
- **Top-up** — additional fuel/transport money for a vehicle, paid via momo
  (`bussingTopUp`, `vehicleTopUp`).
- **IMCL** — referenced in code as a form to be filled before banking
  (`checkIfIMCLNotFilled`). Acronym not expanded in the source; treat as a Poimen-app
  prerequisite form.

## Arrivals (bussing)

- **Arrivals** — the Sunday flow of buses arriving at a Stream service. The arrivals
  module tracks pre-mobilisation pictures, vehicles in transit, arrival times, and
  payments to drivers.
- **Mobilisation** — the time window before bussing during which Bacentas take a
  pre-mobilisation picture.
- **Outbound** — boolean flag on a Bacenta/VehicleRecord indicating the trip is the
  return journey, not the arrival.
- **Bussing window** — derived from a Stream's `mobilisationStartTime`,
  `mobilisationEndTime`, `arrivalStartTime`, `arrivalEndTime`.
- **Bussing top-up** / **Vehicle top-up** — momo payouts to drivers.
- **Bacentas no activity / mobilising / on the way / below 8 / have arrived /
  not counted** — the named live-status buckets surfaced by the arrivals dashboard
  (`HigherChurchWithArrivals` interface).

## Accounts

- **AccountTransaction** — a deposit, expense, or transfer line on an account
  (`pages/accounts/transaction-history/transaction-types`).
- **Council deposit** — money flowing from a Council into the campus account.
- **Bussing expense** — money paid out for the Sunday bussing operation.
- **Request expense** — pending request for funds; needs approval.
- **Approval** — manager sign-off step on a request expense
  (`pages/accounts/approvals`).
- **HR amount / weekday balance / bussing society balance / bussing amount** —
  named ledger buckets per Council (`CouncilForAccounts` fields).

## Geographic / scheduling

- **Accra campus** vs **Outside Accra** — driven by the weekly background reports
  (`accra-campus-weekly`, `outside-accra-weekly`); used by report logic, not by the
  schema. Outside-Accra timing uses the previous Sunday's date when fellowship-mode
  is active (see commit history).
- **Church week** — **Monday → Sunday**, matching ISO 8601 / Neo4j's `date().week`.
  Sunday is the **last** day of the church week, not the first. Sunday's bussing,
  service record, and banking all belong to the week that ends on that Sunday.
  Every week range surfaced in the UI (arrivals selector, reports, weekly
  aggregates) must use this framing — do not introduce Sun→Sat ranges. The
  canonical helpers are `getIsoWeek` / `toWeekKey` in
  `web-react-ts/src/pages/reports/_shared/week-utils.ts`, `isoWeekMonday` in
  `web-react-ts/src/hooks/useSelectedWeek.ts`, and the local `weekStartOf` in
  `web-react-ts/src/hooks/useSelectedArrivalDate.ts`. Aggregate keys keyed by
  week (`<churchId>-<week>-<year>`, ADR-014) use the same Mon→Sun boundary.
- **Sabbath** — Mondays after 4am show the Sabbath splash screen
  (`web-react-ts/src/auth/Sabbath.tsx`, currently commented out in `index.tsx`).
- **Maintenance mode** — manual flag; can be enabled by uncommenting in
  `web-react-ts/src/index.tsx`.

## Shepherding

- **Shepherding Control meeting** — a periodic accountability meeting where leaders
  at every level (Bishop down to Bacenta Leader) are assessed against weekly
  performance criteria (attendance, income, bussing, etc.). The aim is threefold:
  surface where shepherds are failing so they can correct course, cull out
  non-performing shepherds and leaders, and encourage those who are doing well.
  Functions as a leaderboard. The portal's **Shepherding Control** view is the
  projection-display tool used to run these meetings live (see SYN-86); each slide
  shows a leader's photo, their church, and a multi-week metric chart. A PDF export
  of the same deck is generated ahead of the meeting so attendees can follow along.

## Codebase patterns

- **Servant resolver factory** — the data-driven generator that turns
  `servant-config.ts` entries into Apollo mutations
  (`api/src/resolvers/directory/servant-resolver-factory.ts`).
- **Route arrays** — every page lives in a `*Routes.ts` array of `LazyRouteTypes`
  and is spread into `AppWithContext.tsx`. Direct `<Route>` JSX is the wrong pattern.
- **`permitMe(level)`** — the union of leader + admin + arrivals + teller roles for
  a given church level, used as the standard "any privileged user at this level" gate.
- **`useClickCard`** — the hook that owns the in-memory IDs of the currently-viewed
  church at every level (`bacentaId`, `governorshipId`, etc.). Avoid duplicating
  this state.
